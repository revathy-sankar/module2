			Dancing</div>
			<p>It is a kind of sports that every generation enjoys. On every special occasion I feel like dancing. When I dance in the parties nobody can stop me from moving my feet fast in the rhythm of the music. Even if someone does that it's like applying efforts to stop a natural-disaster </p>

            <p>A flip book or flick book is a book with a series of pictures that very gradually change from one page to the next, so that when the pages are turned rapidly, the pictures appear to animate by simulating motion or some other change.
